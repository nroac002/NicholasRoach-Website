        <div class="subheading mb-5">Education MajorðŸ“š</div>
        <p class="lead mb-4">Hello, my name is Nicholas Roach and i am a current second year at the University of California Riverside. My major is Education with my minor to soon be History. I am planning on using the skills and qualifications I obtain from my education to pursue a teaching career in secondary education high school. Within the next five years, I am hoping to be teaching high school level history most likely in either Oregon, Washington, or Idaho. Living in California since I was born leads me to dream about working outside of this heated state and this is definitely been a big motivator to move and work out of the state once I finish my education. <br><br>

I am quite the busy body when it comes to having hobbies. I spend much of my free time playing a handful of different instruments but predominantly I play guitar, banjo, and the ukelele. Along with my hours of music playing throughout the day, I also enjoy spending much of my time with my friends at my house. Every night we have a routine of arguing about what to watch especially now with the new Disney+ streaming service. Another hobby of mine includes rock climbing. I began rock climbing just last year and have been going pretty often since. I have met a lot of cool people while climbing and overall it is neat to be able to share such a fun workout with other people at the UCR Rec-Center. <br><br>

Along with being such a strong musician I also have an extensive collection of different music. I collect a few dozen vinyls and also have multiple Spotify playlists with hundreds of hours of music. Jokingly, my friends poke about my music taste since it is not necessarily what one would call an average music taste. For instance, I listen to genres like ska-punk and some random unknown indie bands. I enjoy music so much that I would rather give up visual sight than go deaf. I cannot imagine life without the beauty of sounds and music and so much of who a person is to me is emulated through their voice and tone. <br><br>

My personality type is INFP or also known as a mediator. This means Iâ€™m pretty introverted in unknown situations but incredibly extroverted when I am comfortable. For example, when I am with my friends I am very much a people person and can be the center of attention. While on the other hand, if I am in a new situation I can be quite shy and avoid interactions with people. Being a mediator is great when it comes to people since I can easily connect with them and also read their emotions like the back of my hand. Although this can seem negative, I consider one of the foundational qualities of who I am and value this trait about myself. <br><br>

Overall, I am a pretty interesting person. I have many different hobbies that characterize me quite a bit and I am very friendly to anyone I encounter. From rock climbing, to simply playing music for my friends, I am anything but boring. <br><br>
